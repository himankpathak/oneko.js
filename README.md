# oneko.js

A hacky script I wrote to put a cat on my site.

The default image is `oneko.gif` in the same directory as the script. This can be changed by adding `data-cat="yourimage.png"` to your `<script>` tag.

This script is meant to be simple so that it can easily be extended upon. Pull requests adding features not seen in the [original neko program 
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_(software)) will probably not be merged.
